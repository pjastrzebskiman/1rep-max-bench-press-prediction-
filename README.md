# 1rep-max-bench-press-prediction-
crippled version algoritm predicting 1RM based on 5RM and 3RM using linear regresion.

Why I did this?
I created this algorithm during preparations for My Engineering Thesis. I had to get acquainted with ML.NET. Addotionaly I use algorithm prediction one rep max in the gym, so I kill two birds with one stone.

What I learned ?

I learned how to:
- use statistical models in ML.NET,
- read metrics (RMS error and R^2),
- load data to learn,
- create MLContext, pipeline, transforms and prediction.
